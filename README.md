# My CODE1 Challenge

## Learning goals

- Create a program that inputs student marks.
- Create a program that inputs  the speed of a car.
- Create a program that calculates an individual's Net Salary by getting inputs of basic salary and benefit

## Getting started
Create your own repository in github nd once your done create 3 different files for each codde challenge but include then in one folder. Use JavaScript to demonstarte the code challenges.

## Create a student-grade.js file
This indicates the grading system for exams done and the end marks. Here we will use the function method.


## Create a speed-detector.js file
In this file it will indicate the output containing the points, "ok" and license suspended.Speedlimit given is 70 and the kmPerPoint is 5.
If the output is "ok" then th speed limit was below 70.
If the output is "licence suspended" then the points were more than 12.
And lastly an output where the points are  below  12.

## The content in the speed-detector.js file
At the const pint you will use "Math.floor". This is simply used to simply a decimal number:
for example: "3.5", the output will result to 3
the formula used to calculate the point is
   - 'Math.floor((speed - speedlimit) / kmperPoint)'
This enables the system to run and bring determine the output.

## Create net-salary-calculator.js file
This is a program that will enable one to calculate an individuals salary.
